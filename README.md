# [angular-ngrx-dynamic-form-generator](https://github.com/wahid-racheh/angular-ngrx-form-generator)

This app serves as a JSON powered dynamic form generator library for Angular. It demonstrate a preconfigured application build with angular, ngrx, storybook and material framework that bring some features to manage your application's forms by providing a JSON configuration schema as an entry, and than render dynamically and recursively all your form elements.

[Live Demo](https://angular-ngrx-form-generator.netlify.com)

## Technical stack

- [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) (v9.0.1")
- [Angular material](https://v7.material.angular.io/) (v9.0.0)
- [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) (v5.3.13)
- [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) (v24.9.0)

## System Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org) v10.16.3 or greater
- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com) v6.9.0 or greater
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) (which require ruby)

All of these must be available in your PATH. To verify things are set up properly, you can run this:

```sh
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

## Requirement for sonar plugin

- [SonarQube](https://docs.sonarqube.org)
- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) (v11+)

After that, go to the project folder and install all npm dependencies, then run the application in development mode.

```sh
$ npm run setup
```

```sh
$ npm start
```

You are now ready to go, your application is available at http://localhost:4200.

## Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>"npm run setup" command not working</summary>

Here's what the setup script does. If it fails, try doing each of these things
individually yourself in every package:

```
# verify your environment will work with the project
node ./scripts/verify

# install dependencies
npm i

# verify the project is ready to run
npm run build
```

If any of those scripts fail, please try to work out what went wrong by the
error message you get.
